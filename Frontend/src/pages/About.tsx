                Patent Insight Agent is designed for preliminary patent analysis and assistance only. It is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a comprehensive patentability search conducted by a qualified patent attorney or agent.
              </p>
              <p>
                While our system utilizes advanced AI techniques and a large database of existing patents, it may not identify all relevant prior art or potential issues with a patent application. The analysis and recommendations provided should be used as a starting point for further investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users should always consult with a qualified patent attorney before making decisions about patent applications or responding to office actions.
